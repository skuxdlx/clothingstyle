<h1>clothing style</h1>

<P>if you want to dress skux, make sure you wear baggy or oversize clothing. it either has to be brand new, or really old. Old t-shirts and long pants are perfect for looking skux, think early 2000's rapper style.
when choosing your colours make sure to have at least one black item of clothing, weather its shoes or a hoodie it can make all the difference. Accesories are also very important to looking skux, make sure to include a chain, a ring, or even
grills (allthough grills are only for the richest of skux).</P>
