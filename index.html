<h5>Base Clothes</h5>
<P>if you want to dress skux, make sure you wear baggy or oversize clothing. it either has to be brand new, or really old. Old t-shirts and long jeans are perfect for looking skux, think early 2000's rapper style.
when choosing your colours make sure to have at least one black item of clothing, weather its shoes or a hoodie it can make all the difference.</P>


     <h5>Shoes</h5>
     <p>When picking skux shoes, make sure they are nice and chunky. Shoes like timbs, DC's, and most jordans are all very skux. Another unexpected pick for skux shoes is steel toe boots, usually for build sites. They show that you put in the mahi to get the treats, which is very skux. </p>

<h5>Accesories</h5>
    <p>Grills, Chains,some (not most) earrings, and things with fake diamonds (they have to be fake otherwise your too rich to be skux) are all very skux. Chains with money symbols are especially skux because they show that you keep money close to your heart</p>
